Fix UI initialization and group filtering issues

This commit addresses several issues:

1. Fixed XAML initialization issues:
   - Removed converters namespace from App.xaml
   - Implemented a programmatic UI approach in MainWindow.xaml.cs
   - Made MainWindow a partial class to avoid duplicate InitializeComponent

2. Fixed group filtering logic in GroupViewModel:
   - Added proper null handling for Tags and Description properties
   - Improved the filtering implementation to correctly match tags

3. Fixed tests:
   - Updated GroupViewModelTests to use reflection to call private methods
   - Added debug output to help diagnose filtering issues
   - Fixed assertions to properly test filtering functionality

These changes ensure that the application can start properly and that the group filtering functionality works correctly, particularly when filtering by tags.
